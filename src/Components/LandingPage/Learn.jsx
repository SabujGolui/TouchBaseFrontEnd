            <p>
                TouchBase was created by a job-seeking web developer who knew first hand how frustrating
                and disorganized looking for a new job can be. The app is designed to take the stress out of
                keeping track of all the jobs you've recently applied to and the connections with professionals
                you've made along the way. 
                
                TouchBase knows about that spreadsheet you use to throw in all your jumbled job application
                information and wants you to eliminate that. Get what you really want out of keeping the job 
                hunt in order by tracking and managing notes, dates, companies, and career guiding prospects.
